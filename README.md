# How to use this template

Different submissions can be written in the example ```submissionxx.tex``` files. These files are included in the ```Main.tex``` file. If the submission are to be delivered one and one and at least as a whole project, you can just comment out the include ```\include{SubmissionXX}```.

Different include elements are seperated in folders for clearity and is not necessary though it makes this template nice and easy.

If you have images or figures just add them to the /fig folder and use them in your project as (example) ```\includegraphics[scale=0.2]{fig/NTNULOGO}```

You can add pdf includes and other stuff in the /pdf directory and use them in your project with a /pdf in front of filename.
